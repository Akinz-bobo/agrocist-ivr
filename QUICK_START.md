## üîß Next Steps for Production

### 1. Get Africa's Talking Credentials
1. Visit [Africa's Talking](https://africastalking.com)
2. Create account and verify
3. Purchase a voice number for your country
4. Get API credentials from dashboard
5. Set webhook URL: `https://your-domain.com/voice`

### 2. Get OpenAI API Key
1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Create account and add payment method
3. Generate API key
4. Add credits for usage

### 3. Deploy to Production
Choose your deployment method:

- Deploy to DigitalOcean, AWS, or Google Cloud
- Use NGINX as reverse proxy
- Set up SSL certificate with Let's Encrypt
- Configure PM2 for process management

#### Option B: Heroku (Easy)
```bash
heroku create agrocist-ivr
heroku addons:create heroku-redis:mini
git push heroku main
```

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Real-time Monitoring
- View logs: `tail -f logs/combined.log`
- Check sessions: Redis CLI monitoring
- Health checks: `GET /health` endpoint

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Call Volume:** Daily/hourly call patterns
- **AI Accuracy:** Response confidence scores
- **Escalation Rate:** AI ‚Üí Human handoff frequency
- **Popular Topics:** Most common veterinary queries
- **Response Times:** System performance metrics

## üîê Security Checklist

### Before Going Live
- [ ] Change default JWT secret
- [ ] Set up HTTPS with valid SSL certificate
- [ ] Configure firewall (ports 80, 443, 22 only)
- [ ] Set up Redis password authentication
- [ ] Enable rate limiting
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Configure log rotation
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures

## üìà Scaling Considerations

### Current Capacity
- **Concurrent Calls:** ~100-200 (single instance)
- **AI Processing:** Limited by OpenAI rate limits
- **Session Storage:** Redis handles thousands of sessions

### Scaling Options
- **Horizontal:** Multiple server instances + load balancer
- **Database:** Redis cluster or managed Redis
- **AI:** Multiple OpenAI accounts or local models
- **Geographic:** Multi-region deployment

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server won't start:**
```bash
# Check environment variables
cat .env

# Check port availability
netstat -an | grep 3000

# View error logs
cat logs/error.log
```

**Webhook not receiving calls:**
```bash
# Test webhook endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/voice \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sessionId":"test","phoneNumber":"+254700000000"}'

# Check Africa's Talking webhook URL
# Verify SSL certificate if using HTTPS
```

**AI responses failing:**
```bash
# Test OpenAI API key
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"

# Check API quota and billing
```

### Log Analysis
```bash
# View recent logs
tail -100 logs/combined.log

# Search for errors
grep "error" logs/combined.log

# Monitor real-time
tail -f logs/combined.log | grep -i "error\|warning"
```
